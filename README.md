My First Dealings With Python

05/05/2021
App1 - My first ever Pything Tkinter app. It is a simple GUI app that takes an input, validates it (checks if there is text entred). If there is text add it to the listbox and if no text is entered then flash a warning to enter name

Added a Clear button to the App, which when selected will clear all the contents of the listbox.
